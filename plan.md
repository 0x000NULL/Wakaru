# ManabU - Implementation Plan & Roadmap

## Development Philosophy

### Phased Approach
Build in stages, validating each phase before moving forward. Each phase delivers usable value while building toward the complete vision.

### Priority Framework
1. **Must Have (MVP)**: Core learning functionality, cannot launch without it
2. **Should Have (V1.0)**: Important features that significantly enhance learning
3. **Nice to Have (V2.0+)**: Valuable additions that can be added post-launch
4. **Future Consideration**: Ideas to explore later based on user feedback
